## Project

Welcome to MOT, the garbage detection on river banks github. It is part of a project led by [Surfrider Europe](https://surfrider.eu/), which aims at quantifying plastic pollution in rivers through space and time.

MOT stands for Multi-Object Tracking, as we detect, then track the different plastic trash instances.

The object detection part is based on [tensorpack](https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack).

### Dataset

You can download a training dataset on this [link](http://files.heuritech.com/raw_files/dataset_surfrider_cleaned.zip).

### Installation

You may run directly the [notebook in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/surfriderfoundationeurope/mot/blob/master/notebooks/object_detection_training_and_inference.ipynb).

For more details on training and inference of the object detection please see the following [file](src/mot/object_detection/README.md) which is based on the README of tensorpack.

#### Classic

To install locally, make sure you have Python 3.3+ and  1.6 <= tensorflow < 2.0

```bash
apt install libsm6 libxrender-dev libxext6 libcap-dev ffmpeg
pip3 install --user .
```

#### Docker

The following command will build a docker for development and run interactively.

```bash
make docker-training
```

## Developpers

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Developper installation

You need to install the repository in dev:

```bash
pip install -e ./
```

The following libraries are needed to run the tests: `pytest`, `pytest-cov`

### Use with pyenv

```bash
pyenv activate my_amazing_surfrider_project
pip install .
```

### Run the tests

* To run all the tests:

```bash
make tests
```

* To run a specific test

```bash
pytest my_file.py::my_function
```
